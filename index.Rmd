# Part 1: Introduction and Data Exploration

The aim of this document is to present you with the bare minimum essentials to get you up and running with R.
One of the toughest parts about  learning a programming language is feeling overwhelmed by the abundance of material to learn.

By giving you an overview of the most useful functions, in the lens of a real dataset, we hope that you can apply these concepts to your own data.

As with everything else, the best way to learn R is through **consistent** practice with a real world project.

## Goals
By the end of this document, you will be able to:

1. Learn about the fundamental R Datatypes
2. Read a CSV file into your R environment
3. Write from your R environment to a CSV file
4. Explore different attributes of a dataframe
    - column names
    - row names
    - more with `attributes()`
    - Subset a dataframe by rows and columns
    - Filter a dataframe by the values of a column
5. Use two data exploration and cleaning functions
    - Frequency counts of unique values with `table()`
    - Search for any duplicates within your data with `duplicated()`

In this section, we introduce to you the Fundamental R Datatypes, Data input and data output, as well as some useful data exploration functions.
