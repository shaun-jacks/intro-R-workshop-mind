# Overview and Introduction

The aim of this workshop is to get you up and running with R as quick as possible by teaching you how to connect the most important R constructs through hands-on examples.
One of the toughest parts about  learning a programming language is feeling overwhelmed by the abundance of material to learn.

By giving you an overview of the most useful functions, in the lens of close-to-real-world artificial datasets, we hope that you can apply these concepts to your own data. 

As with everything else, the best way to learn R is through **consistent** practice with a real world project.
